### Introduction:
<br/> 
This repository contains the code and link to the data for a data science capstone project on Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction and comparison of states and counties.
<br/>
<br/>
The project consists of several Python notebooks that document the data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, time series modeling, and data finalization.
It also contains an interactive tableau file that highlights the historical and forecasted AQI by State/County.
<br/>

### AirWise:
<br/>
AirWise is a visualization tool that allows individuals and businesses to understand and compare historical and forecasted air quality index (AQI) data for state and county combinations. The tool is based on the results of our data analysis and modeling, which provides accurate AQI predictions within an acceptable range.
<br/>

### Practical Uses:
<br/>
Predicting AQI levels can help individuals understand the AQI of their area or the area they want to live in. It will also help various businesses that emit air pollutants as part of their day-to-day operations regulate their output and optimize their operations to reduce emissions based on the predicted AQI for the week/month period. Predicting AQI levels can also help individuals identify areas of high risks to mitigate health risks associated with poor air quality or real-estate developers promote areas or avoid areas where AQI may be poor. Additionally, the tool can be used to inform public policy decisions around air quality regulations and mitigation strategies.
